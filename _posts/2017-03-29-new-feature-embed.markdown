Kodethon has a new feature!  Now, you can embed a Kodethon project directly into
any webpage.  We call this feature <b>Embed</b>.  You can watch the video above
and play with examples below.

<em>Q: Who can use this feature?</em> <br/>
A: <b>Anyone!</b>  All you have to do is create a
Kodethon project.  And get its embed link.  We believe that anyone who writes
regularly about programming subjects like bloggers, tutorial writers, teachers,
and researchers will find this feature useful.  <a href="https://3b5d30f75af09e6233bd7b4ce3853de8-environ.kodethon.com/demo/index.html" target="_blank">Here is an example of how you might incorporate this into a blog.</a>

<em>Q: When would <b>you</b>, personally, use this feature? </em><br/> 
A: <b>Anytime</b> you want to share code in a webpage and want your users to play with the code.  In other words, when you want them to edit the code and run it to see the effect of their changes. 

<em>Q: How does this compare to similar tools?</em><br/> 
A: Currently, there are many good
code syntax highlighters out there: <a
href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a>, <a
href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>, <a
href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism</a>, and many others!  But perhaps the best
comparison is with [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).  JSFiddle provides a nice
way of embedding frontend projects with multiple files. Kodethon, however,
allows you to embed any type of project currently supported by Kodethon.  This
includes projects which normally do not run in the browser like C++, Java
programs.
