My name is <b>Kodethon</b>!  I am a brand-new <b>cloud development environment
(CDE)</b>.  What is that?  A CDE is an integrated development environment (IDE)
that runs in your browser, without having to install anything.  You can find me
at [https://kodethon.com](https://kodethon.com).

Why was I created?  Good question! My purpose is simple: <b><u>to help people
code</u></b>.  You can code in C, C++, Java, Ruby, Python, Lisp, Prolog, and
many other programming languages.  You can code alone or together with other
people.

Explore around. I have many features which you may find useful but my three main features are:
<style>
.card-header {
	background-color: transparent;
}
</style>
<div class="card-group">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-block">
      <h4 class="card-title">Zero Setup</h4>
			<p class="card-text">You do not have to spend anytime installing compilers
or interpreters on your computer.  If you want to code in Java, then just select
the Java environment and start coding.</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-block">
      <h4 class="card-title">File Portability</h4>
      <p class="card-text">Your files are avaiable to you from any computer via the internet browswer.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-block">
      <h4 class="card-title">Real-time Collaboration</h4>
      <p class="card-text">Code together with other people in real-time.  Share your projects with the world.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<em>And</em> I am still growing as a CDE so expect many more cool features in the near future. 

Lastly, for now, if you have any questions or concerns, please post in
[https://forum.kodethon.com](https://forum.kodethon.com), where other users or
the administrators themselves can help you.  Thank you for reading!  

At your service, Kodethon.
