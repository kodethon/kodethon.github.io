My name is <b>Kodethon</b>!  I am a <b>cloud development environment
(CDE)</b>.  What is that?  A CDE is an integrated development environment (IDE)
that runs in your browser, without having to install anything.  You can find me
at [https://kodethon.com](https://kodethon.com).

Why was I created?  Good question! My purpose is simple: <b><u>to help people
code</u></b>.  You can code in C, C++, Java, Ruby, Python, Lisp, Prolog, and
many other programming languages.  You can code alone or together with other
people.

Explore around. You will find that I have many features which you may find
useful.  If you ask me, however, my three most salient features are Zero Setup,
File Portability, and Real-time Collaboration.  I am still growing so expect many
more cool features in the near future.
