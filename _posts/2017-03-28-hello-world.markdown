My name is <b>Kodethon</b>!  I am a brand-new <b>cloud development environment
(CDE)</b>.  What is that?  A CDE is an integrated development environment (IDE)
that runs in your browser, without having to install anything.

Why was I created?  Good question! My purpose is simple: <b><u>to help people code</u></b>.
You can find me at [https://kodethon.com](https://kodethon.com).
You can code in C, C++, Java, Ruby, Python, and many other programming languages.
You can code alone or together with other people.

My three main features are:
1. <b>Zero-setup</b>: You do not have to spend anytime installing compilers or interpreters on your computer.  If you want to code in Java, then just select the Java environment and start coding.
2. <b>File Portability</b>: Your files are avaiable to you from any computer via the internet browswer.
3. <b>Real-time Collaboration</b>: Code together with other people in real-time.  Share your projects with the world.

I have many more features which you may find useful.  Explore around.  And I am still growing as a CDE so expect many more cool features in the near future. 

Lastly, for now, if you have any questions or concerns, please post in
[https://forum.kodethon.com](https://forum.kodethon.com), where other users or
the administrators themselves can help you.  Thank you for reading!
