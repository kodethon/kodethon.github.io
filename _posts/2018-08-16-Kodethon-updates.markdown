Kodethon has grown a lot over the past few years.
When we started building Kodethon, we wanted to build an easy-to-use,
easy-to-learn, yet powerful online integrated development environment (IDE) for
university students.
Now, Kodethon can support programming all of the programming languages used to
teach at UC Davis.  Since we first deployed it in Spring 2015, it has been used
by over 3,000 students in at least 15 different courses.

We also observed that Kodethon could help instructors as well.  Computer
Science instructors need a system to create, collect, and automatically grade
programming assignments.  Leveraging Kodethon's storage and execution power, we
built <a href="https://www.kodethon.com/#/courses">Courses</a>.  Instructors
can create assignments and set up test cases in Kodethon.  When students submit
their assignment, Kodethon builds their program and rans it with the given test
cases.  It gives them feedback about which test cases pass and which fail.

To date, it has been used in at least four different courses including
Introdution to Programming (ECS 10), Introduction to Programming (ECS 30),
Machine-dependent Programming (ECS 50), and Theory of Computation (ECS 120).  A
couple of professors, one from <a href="http://www.uh.edu/">University of
Houston</a> and one from <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>,
are intersted in using Kodethon in their universities.
